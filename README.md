# Zomboid Stash

Quick-stash your hard-earned loot to nearby containers, from up to 8 tiles away!

## FAQ

> The plugin is not working ...

Make sure you install [Manage Containers](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2650547917), and make sure Zomboid Stash loads AFTER Manage Containers in the Mod Load Order.

> What's the Hotkey, and how do I change it?

The default is `/` (forward slash), and you can change it in your Game Options, under Key Bindings, Hotkeys.
